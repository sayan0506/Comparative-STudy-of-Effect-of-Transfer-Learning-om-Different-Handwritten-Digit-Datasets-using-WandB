# Comparative Study Between Different Handwritten Digit Datasets using transfer Learning, and Learning from Scratch, detailed Report analysis Using WandB

MIDAS IITD internship task

Collab Notebook link: [Task 2 notebbok](https://github.com/sayan0506/Task-2-Internship/blob/main/IIITD_assignment_task_2_test_script.ipynb)

All the references and studies and procedures are attached in that notebook mentioned above. All the training reports are logged in my WeightsandBiases account.

The training report log:

1. [Section 1 report](https://wandb.ai/sayan0506/Master%20Training)
2. [Section 2 report](https://wandb.ai/sayan0506/MNIST%20Training%20section%202)
3. [Section 3 report](https://wandb.ai/sayan0506/MNISTtask3%20data%20Training%20section%203)

I have saved all the necessary weights and model json files in google drive link

[Model Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10iaQeAecoaPE508WevrnPFPrukOpvryj)

I have compared the model performances in section 1,2,3 based on

1. Classification report
2. Confusion Matrix
3. GradCAM(Gradientweighted Class Activation Map)

Future work:

Using [Capsule Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829) to test the dataset.
